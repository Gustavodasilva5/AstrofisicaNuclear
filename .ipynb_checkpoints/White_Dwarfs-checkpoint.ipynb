    "# The structure and properties of White Dwarfs\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook is part of the [Nuclear Astrophysics](https://master.us.es/fisicanuclear/index.php/cursos-2015-2017/astrofisica-nuclear-2) module of the [Inter-University Nuclear Physics Master's](https://master.us.es/fisicanuclear/index.php). The aim is to understand how to solve the stellar structure equations for white dwarf stars, with pressure provided by a degenerate electron gas. Pedagogical introductions to this topic can be found in the references [Jackson2004](Jacksoon2004).\n",
    "\n",
    "The equations to solve involve the equation of hydrostatic equilibium and the mass conservation equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align} \n",
    "\\frac{dP(r)}{dr}& = - \\frac{G m(r) \\rho(r)}{r^2} \\, , \\label{eq:pressure} \\tag{1} \\\\ \n",
    "\\frac{dm_<(r)}{dr}& = 4 \\pi r^2 \\rho(r) \\, . \\label{eq:mass}  \\tag{2} \n",
    "\\end{align} \n",
    "These equation relate the following variables:\n",
    " - $r$ is a radial coordinate spanning from the center of the star, $r=0$, to the radius of the star, $r=R$. \n",
    " - $P(r)$ is the pressure profile in the interior of the star, with two boundary conditions: a central pressure, $P(r=0)=P_c$, and the zero pressure at the stellar radius, $P(r=R)=0$. \n",
    " - The density profile, $\\rho(r)$, has the corresponding boundary conditions $\\rho(r=0)=\\rho_c$ and $\\rho(r=R)=0$. \n",
    " - $m_<(r)$ corresponds to the enclosed mass up to a given radial coordinate $r$. In other words, there is no mass at the central point, $m_<(r=0)=0$, whereas at the surface it encloses all the mass of the star, $m_<(r=R)=M$. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Physical considerations \n",
    "For a degenerate star, the two equations above are supplemented by an equation of state relating the pressure to the mass density, $P \\equiv P(\\rho)$. For a relativistic system of fermions, the density dependence is usually expressed in terms of the Fermi momentum. This is typically written in terms of the number density, $n$, as opposed to the mass density, $\\rho$, so that $k_F=\\left( 3 \\pi^2 n \\right)^{1/3}$. Furthermore, one can define the dimensionless Fermi momentum, $x_F=\\frac{\\hbar k_F}{m c}$, where $m$ is the mass of the particle providing the pressure (electrons in this case). This dimensionless ratio of two momenta defines two different regimes. A non-relativistic degenerate gas typicall has $x_F \\ll 1$, whereas a relativistic degenerate one has $x_F \\gg 1$. }$\n",

    "How does one compute the pressure for the relativistic gas? \n",
    "We start with the expression of the energy density of a relativistic gas:\n",
